# Game rules
You wander around NU trying to capture the pokemons on the road and achieving the highest score among your friends.

You start with 3 points. You can only capture the pokemons with points smaller than or equal to your scores. The points of pokemons are displayed on the map. 

Every time you capture a pokemon, your score will increase by the point of the pokemon. 

pokemons with an ! icon are high-point pokemons. Capturing such pokemons will give you a special effect. The special effect can be double points - the points of your next 3 captures will be doubled, half points - the points of your next 3 captures will be havled, or no points - you will not gain any points for your next 3 captures. 

If you capture a pokemon that you have already captured, you will still gain points, but you will not gain special effects again.
