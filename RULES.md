# Game rules
You wander around NU trying to capture the pets on the road and achieving the highest score among your friends.

You start with 3 points. You can only capture the pets with points smaller than or equal to your scores. The points of pets are displayed on the map. 

Every time you capture a pet, your score will increase by the point of the pet. 

Pets with an ! icon are high-point pets. Capturing such pets will give you a special effect. The special effect can be double points - the points of your next 3 captures will be doubled, half points - the points of your next 3 captures will be havled, or no points - you will not gain any points for your next 3 captures.
